  ```

3. In the sign-in windows that appears, sign in by using the Microsoft account that is the Service Administrator of your Azure subscription.

4. If you have multiple subscriptions associated with your Microsoft account, to identify the subscription in which you are going to create a virtual network, type the following command, and then press Enter:

  ```
  Get-AzureRmSubscription
  ```

5. Note the value of the **`Id`** property for each subscription in the output of the previous command. To specify the subscription in which you are going to create a virtual network, type the following commands, and then press Enter (replace **`SubscriptionId`** with the actual SubscriptionId property of that subscription):

  ```
  Set-AzureRmContext -SubscriptionId 'SubscriptionId'
  ```

6. Type the following cmdlet, and then press Enter:

  ```
  Find-AzureRMResource -ResourceGroupNameContains 20533D0301-LabRG | Format-Table -Property ResourceName, ResourceType
  ```

7. In the cmdlet output, note the resources created in this exercise including virtual machines, disks, NICs, public IPs, and a storage account.

8. Leave the Windows PowerShell ISE window open for the next exercise.


> **Result**: After completing this exercise, you should have deployed an Azure VM by using Visual Studio and an Azure Resource Manager template.


## Exercise 2: Using Azure PowerShell and an Azure Resource Manager template to deploy Azure VMs

5. Switch to Visual Studio and click **File**, click **Open**, and then click **File**.

6. In the **Open File** dialog box, navigate to the E:\\Labfiles\\Lab03\\Starter\\Templates folder.

7. Click **azuredeploywebvm.json**, and then click **Open**.
> **Note:** Note that the template has a very similar structure to the template for the Linux virtual machines in the previous exercise. The primary differences between the two templates include the variables identifying the operating system image, the target subnet, and the availability set. You could replace these variables with equivalent parameters, in order to minimize the number of templates used to deploy Azure VMs. 

8. Close Visual Studio.

9. Switch back to the Windows PowerShell ISE window and run the **Deploy-AzureResourceGroup.ps1** script. When prompted, provide the following values for the parameter prompts, pressing Enter after each value:
